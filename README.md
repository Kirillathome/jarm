# jarm
Jarm is a small Tech Minecraft Mod I'm coding.
This is currently WIP and may get discontinued.


Also, I'm not a professional coder. 


#Installation

Compile this Mod by running `./gradlew build` (just `gradlew build` on Windows). The finished jar file should be located in `build/libs/`.

Then (if you haven't yet) install the Fabric Mod Loader (read https://fabricmc.net/#installation for more information). After that, put the Mod in `(your-minecraft-directory)/mods/`. This mod requires the Fabric API so install it too. Now, launch Minecraft and enjoy the Mod!
